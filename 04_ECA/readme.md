-Each cell can be filled or empty  
-Each cell is defined by the 3 cells directly above it, in the previous row  
-A rule defines whether a given configuration of 3 cells results in a filled child cell  

-Each button at the top determines whether the child of that parent configuration (eg 101, 001)
will be filled in or not. Click a button to change the rule.
